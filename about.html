		<h1>About Campus Convoz</h1>
		<br>
		<b>Campus Convoz</b> is a project by <a href="http://sarahddubs.com">Sarah Dapul-Weberman</a> and <a href="http://stanford.edu/~scottk92">Scott Khamphoune</a> for <a href="http://cs376.stanford.edu">CS376: Research Topics in
	Human-Computer Interaction</a>, taught by Michael Bernstein in Spring 2013. 
	Right now, Campus Convoz has only launched to Stanford University.  
	<br><br><!-- inspiration about stanford confessions -->
	<b>Campus Convoz</b> was inspired by our obsession with Stanford Confessions and Omegle. 
	<br><br> 
	Stanford Confessions allows students to anonymously express themselves, but doesn't 
	have a way for students to <i>engage</i> with one another anonymously in a one-on-one
	conersation.<br>
	Omegle provides for that anonymous conversation, but has no attachment to a community 
	whatsoever and thus loses the meaningfulness of a community coming together and 
	talking to each other. <br><br>
	We are interested in the way anonymity acts as a double-edged sword: on one hand, it 
	protects our identity and offers a safe way to express ourselves genuinely, but on 
	the other hand, it may encourage 'trolls' to act irresponsibly and offensively.  
	Our hope is that Campus Convoz can become a safe, outlet where students can converse 
	with each other intimately.
	<br>
	<br><br><b>Why "Campus Convoz"?</b><br>
	Well, campusconvos.com was taken. So was campusconversations.com, campuschat.com, campusanonymous.com, and basically everything else we tried.
